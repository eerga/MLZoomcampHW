# Churn Prediction

We got a bunch of clients that might not be happy with the services we are providing. We want to identify clients who will stop using our services. 

We are going to score the likelihood of each customer churning. As the score goes higher, we are going to send out a promotional email, encouraging them to continue using the company information

## Binary Classification

y, the likelihood, is from 0 to 1 (0 - no churn and 1 - churn)

x, can include variables such as where they live, how much the customer pays, kind of services and contract they have. 

We are going to look at the existing customers, and see where this leads.
